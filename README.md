# Firebase Realtime Database: Unexpected PERMISSION_DENIED Error

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error occurs in Firebase Realtime Database, despite having seemingly correct security rules. The issue stems from caching mechanisms within the Firebase client or deployment discrepancies.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `solution.js` offers a solution to mitigate this issue.

## Solution

The key to resolving this is to ensure that:

1. **Your security rules are correctly deployed:** Verify that the rules in the Firebase console match the rules being used by your application.  Use the Firebase CLI to deploy rules explicitly. 
2. **Client-side caching is handled:** Implement mechanisms to refresh or invalidate the cached rules.  This can involve forcing a re-fetch of the rules (e.g., after a rule update) or using techniques to clear any cached data from the client.
